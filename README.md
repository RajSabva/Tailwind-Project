Tailwind CSS Website Project
This project showcases the creation of a responsive website using Tailwind CSS, emphasizing key concepts like positioning, responsiveness, and flexbox layouts. By leveraging Tailwind's utility-first approach, I streamlined the styling process, making development faster and more efficient. The website is designed to adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on any device. This repository includes the full source code and the styling configuration used in the project.
